![Master branch build status](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

NetBox is an infrastructure resource modeling (IRM) tool designed to empower
network automation, used by thousands of organizations around the world.
Initially conceived by the network engineering team at
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), NetBox was developed specifically
to address the needs of network and infrastructure engineers. It is intended to
function as a domain-specific source of truth for network operations.

Myriad infrastructure components can be modeled in NetBox, including:

* Hierarchical regions, site groups, sites, and locations
* Racks, devices, and device components
* Cables and wireless connections
* Power distribution
* Data circuits and providers
* Virtual machines and clusters
* IP prefixes, ranges, and addresses
* VRFs and route targets
* FHRP groups (VRRP, HSRP, etc.)
* AS numbers
* VLANs and scoped VLAN groups
* Organizational tenants and contacts

In addition to its extensive built-in models and functionality, NetBox can be
customized and extended through the use of:

* Custom fields
* Custom links
* Configuration contexts
* Custom model validation rules
* Reports
* Custom scripts
* Export templates
* Conditional webhooks
* Plugins
* Single sign-on (SSO) authentication
* NAPALM integration
* Detailed change logging

NetBox also features a complete REST API as well as a GraphQL API for easily
integrating with other tools and systems.

NetBox runs as a web application atop the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
Python framework with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. For a
complete list of requirements, see `requirements.txt`. The code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox).

The complete documentation for NetBox can be found at [docs.netbox.dev](https://docs.netbox.dev/). A public demo instance is available at https://demo.netbox.dev.
