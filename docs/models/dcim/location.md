# Locations

Racks and devices can be grouped by location within a site. A location may represent a floor, room, cage, or similar organizational unit. Locations can be nested to form a hierarchy. For example, you may have floors within a site, and rooms within a floor.

Each location must have a name that is unique within its parent site and location, if any.
