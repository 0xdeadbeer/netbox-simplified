# Webhooks

A webhook is a mechanism for conveying to some external system a change that took place in NetBox. For example, you may want to notify a monitoring system whenever the status of a device is updated in NetBox. This can be done by creating a webhook for the device model in NetBox and identifying the webhook receiver. When NetBox detects a change to a device, an HTTP request containing the details of the change and who made it be sent to the specified receiver. Webhooks are managed under Logging > Webhooks.

!!! warning
    Webhooks support the inclusion of user-submitted code to generate URL, custom headers and payloads, which may pose security risks under certain conditions. Only grant permission to create or modify webhooks to trusted users.

## Configuration

* **Name** - A unique name for the webhook. The name is not included with outbound messages.
* **Object type(s)** - The type or types of NetBox object that will trigger the webhook.
* **Enabled** - If unchecked, the webhook will be inactive.
* **Events** - A webhook may trigger on any combination of create, update, and delete events. At least one event type must be selected.
* **HTTP method** - The type of HTTP request to send. Options include `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.
* **URL** - The fully-qualified URL of the request to be sent. This may specify a destination port number if needed. Jinja2 templating is supported for this field.
* **HTTP content type** - The value of the request's `Content-Type` header. (Defaults to `application/json`)
* **Additional headers** - Any additional headers to include with the request (optional). Add one header per line in the format `Name: Value`. Jinja2 templating is supported for this field (see below).
* **Body template** - The content of the request being sent (optional). Jinja2 templating is supported for this field (see below). If blank, NetBox will populate the request body with a raw dump of the webhook context. (If the HTTP cotent type is set to `application/json`, this will be formatted as a JSON object.)
* **Secret** - A secret string used to prove authenticity of the request (optional). This will append a `X-Hook-Signature` header to the request, consisting of a HMAC (SHA-512) hex digest of the request body using the secret as the key.
* **Conditions** - An optional set of conditions evaluated to determine whether the webhook fires for a given object.
* **SSL verification** - Uncheck this option to disable validation of the receiver's SSL certificate. (Disable with caution!)
* **CA file path** - The file path to a particular certificate authority (CA) file to use when validating the receiver's SSL certificate (optional).

## Jinja2 Template Support

[Jinja2 templating](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) is supported for the `URL`, `additional_headers` and `body_template` fields. This enables the user to convey object data in the request headers as well as to craft a customized request body. Request content can be crafted to enable the direct interaction with external systems by ensuring the outgoing message is in a format the receiver expects and understands.

For example, you might create a NetBox webhook to [trigger a Slack message](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) any time an IP address is created. You can accomplish this using the following configuration:

* Object type: IPAM > IP address
* HTTP method: `POST`
* URL: Slack incoming webhook URL
* HTTP content type: `application/json`
* Body template: `{"text": "IP address {{ data['address'] }} was created by {{ username }}!"}`

### Available Context

The following data is available as context for Jinja2 templates:

* `event` - The type of event which triggered the webhook: created, updated, or deleted.
* `model` - The NetBox model which triggered the change.
* `timestamp` - The time at which the event occurred (in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format).
* `username` - The name of the user account associated with the change.
* `request_id` - The unique request ID. This may be used to correlate multiple changes associated with a single request.
* `data` - A detailed representation of the object in its current state. This is typically equivalent to the model's representation in NetBox's REST API.
* `snapshots` - Minimal "snapshots" of the object state both before and after the change was made; provided as a dictionary with keys named `prechange` and `postchange`. These are not as extensive as the fully serialized representation, but contain enough information to convey what has changed.

### Default Request Body

If no body template is specified, the request body will be populated with a JSON object containing the context data. For example, a newly created site might appear as follows:

```json
{
    "event": "created",
    "timestamp": "2021-03-09 17:55:33.968016+00:00",
    "model": "site",
    "username": "jstretch",
    "request_id": "fdbca812-3142-4783-b364-2e2bd5c16c6a",
    "data": {
        "id": 19,
        "name": "Site 1",
        "slug": "site-1",
        "status": 
            "value": "active",
            "label": "Active",
            "id": 1
        },
        "region": null,
        ...
    },
    "snapshots": {
        "prechange": null,
        "postchange": {
            "created": "2021-03-09",
            "last_updated": "2021-03-09T17:55:33.851Z",
            "name": "Site 1",
            "slug": "site-1",
            "status": "active",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```
