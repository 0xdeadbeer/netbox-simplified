# Virtual Machines

A virtual machine represents a virtual compute instance hosted within a cluster. Each VM must be assigned to exactly one cluster.

Like devices, each VM can be assigned a platform and/or functional role, and must have one of the following operational statuses assigned to it:

* Active
* Offline
* Planned
* Staged
* Failed
* Decommissioning

Additional fields are available for annotating the vCPU count, memory (GB), and disk (GB) allocated to each VM. A VM may be allocated a partial vCPU count (e.g. 1.5 vCPU).

Each VM may optionally be assigned to a tenant. Virtual machines may have virtual interfaces assigned to them, but do not support any physical component.
