# Provider Networks

This model can be used to represent the boundary of a provider network, the details of which are unknown or unimportant to the NetBox user. For example, it might represent a provider's regional MPLS network to which multiple circuits provide connectivity.

Each provider network must be assigned to a provider, and may optionally be assigned an arbitrary service ID. A circuit may terminate to either a provider network or to a site.
