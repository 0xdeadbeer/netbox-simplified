# FHRP Group Assignments

Member device and VM interfaces can be assigned to FHRP groups, along with a numeric priority value. For instance, three interfaces, each belonging to a different router, may each be assigned to the same FHRP group to serve a common virtual IP address. Each of these assignments would typically receive a different priority.

Interfaces are assigned to FHRP groups under the interface detail view.
