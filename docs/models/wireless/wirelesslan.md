# Wireless LANs

A wireless LAN is a set of interfaces connected via a common wireless channel. Each instance must have an SSID, and may optionally be correlated to a VLAN. Wireless LANs can be arranged into hierarchical groups.

An interface may be attached to multiple wireless LANs, provided they are all operating on the same channel. Only wireless interfaces may be attached to wireless LANs.

Each wireless LAN may have authentication attributes associated with it, including:

* Authentication type
* Cipher
* Pre-shared key
