# Wireless Links

A wireless link represents a connection between exactly two wireless interfaces. It may optionally be assigned an SSID and a description. It may also have a status assigned to it, similar to the cable model.

Each wireless link may have authentication attributes associated with it, including:

* Authentication type
* Cipher
* Pre-shared key
